# Readme

Welcome to our coding assessment! 

This code should be used as a baseline for question 1. There is a very simple node & express backend that stores files locally and stores the metadata in a simple sqlite database.  The frontend is a basic react app (initialized with create-react-app) with minimal styling.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Start the backend server with `yarn start
3. Access your react server in your browser from localhost:3000 (backend is in localhost:4000)
4. As you make updates, nodemon will generally update the server with your updates but you will manually need to reload your browser window.

## Submission
Note that you don't need to send us any credentials, but provide clear instructions for how to run your application.

1. Populate `discussion.md` with responses to any discussion questions
2. Create a zip file with your code (it is not necessary to include `node_modules`)
3. Submit your zip file and your personal details to the assignmend page [here](https://app.mightyacorn.io/playhouse/coding-challenge)
